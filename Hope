Hope.

What we really want is redemption.
We want second chances. That's really
what separates us from the animals.
The osprey doesn't care that it missed
the tender bass below the surface.
It doesn't pine for the one that swam
away or dove deep beneath its grasp.
It flexes its talons and looks for the next.
A nice perch, perhaps.

I wonder who this red wing sings for.
No one I guess, just like the groan of
the bullfrog across the beach.
The wind pushes the leaves because it can.

People carve their names into the dock.
Immortality for the dying. They just don't
know it yet. Spencer 2011. Ken 99.
Calvin. DF. Lovers etched in wood.

Even here there's movement. The water laps
slowly at the shore.
