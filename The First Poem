The First Poem

After a long time of silence.
It struggles, makes excuses, complains.

Keep writing.

It finds itself distracted by the chirps
of red wing blackbirds, memories of a lone
holly tree, and the blackbird's evening song.

Keep writing.

And then, that too is gone, distracted
by the bird hopping from watter lily to water
lily, which palms it like a child's memory.

Keep writing.

And then gets lost, unable to recall the word
to describe the almost questioning cry of the bird
as it lands, of frogs creaking like old wood.

Keep writing.

Swaying in a breeze, the long strides and slow
graceful glide of the heron over water. Its
gangly feaures turned to poise and beauty.

Keep writing.  

And still the person struggles. Aware of its hurdles,
once easily cleared, now massive, overgrown,
daunting. It slows.

Keep writing.

An osprey circles overhead, looking for fish in the river
below. The whole of the shoreline, as far as can be seen
waves in the breeze. Hello, or goodbye? Or a warning?

Keep writing.

There is a long way to go, and time is always
running short. It's dark now. The person is afraid.
It isn't sure how it is going to end.

Keep writing.
